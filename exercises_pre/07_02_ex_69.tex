{A point on the edge of the spinning yo-yo in Exercise \ref{spinningyoyo} from Section \ref{Angles}. 

Recall: The diameter of the yo-yo is 2.25 inches and it spins at 4500 revolutions per minute.}
{ $r = 1.125$ inches, $\omega = 9000 \pi \, \frac{\text{radians}}{\text{minute}}$,  $x = 1.125 \cos(9000 \pi \, t)$, $y = 1.125 \sin(9000 \pi \, t)$.  Here $x$ and $y$ are measured in inches and $t$ is measured in minutes.}
