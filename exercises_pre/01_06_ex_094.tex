{In Exercise \ref{Sasquatchfunc1} in Section \ref{FunctionNotation}, we saw that the population of Sasquatch in Portage County could be modeled by the function $P(t) = \dfrac{150t}{t + 15}$, where $t = 0$ represents the year 1803. Use your graphing calculator to analyze the general function behaviour of $P$.  Will there ever be a time when 200 Sasquatch roam Portage County?}
