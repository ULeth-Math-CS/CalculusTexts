{The height $h$ in feet of a model rocket above the ground $t$ seconds after lift-off is given by $h(t) = -5t^2+100t$, for $0 \leq t \leq 20$.  When does the rocket reach its maximum height above the ground?  What is its maximum height?}
{The rocket reaches its maximum height of $500$ feet $10$ seconds after lift-off.}
