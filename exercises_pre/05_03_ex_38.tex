{\label{WindChillTemperature} The \href{http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/windchill/windchillglossary.shtml}{\underline{National Weather Service}} uses the following formula to calculate the wind chill: \[ W = 35.74 + 0.6215 \, T_{a} - 35.75\, V^{0.16} + 0.4275 \, T_{a} \, V^{0.16}  \] where $W$ is the wind chill temperature in $^{\circ}$F, $T_{a}$ is the air temperature in $^{\circ}$F, and  $V$ is the wind speed in miles per hour.  Note that $W$ is defined only for air temperatures at or lower than $50^{\circ}$F and wind speeds above $3$ miles per hour.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Suppose the air temperature is $42^{\circ}$ and the wind speed is $7$ miles per hour. Find the wind chill temperature.  Round your answer to two decimal places.

\item  Suppose the air temperature is $37^{\circ}$F and the wind chill temperature is $30^{\circ}$F.  Find the wind speed.  Round your answer to two decimal places. 

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item  $W \approx 37.55^{\circ}$F.

\item  $V \approx 9.84$ miles per hour.

\end{enumerate}}
