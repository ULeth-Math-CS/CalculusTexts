{Another Classic Problem: A can is made in the shape of a right circular cylinder and is to hold one pint. (For dry goods, one pint is equal to $33.6$ cubic inches.)\footnote{According to \href{http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pint}{\underline{www.dictionary.com}}, there are different values given for this conversion.  We will stick with $33.6 \mbox{in}^{3}$ for this problem.}  

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find an expression for the volume $V$ of the can in terms of the height $h$ and the base radius $r$.
\item Find an expression for the surface area $S$ of the can in terms of the height $h$ and the base radius $r$.  (Hint: The top and bottom of the can are circles of radius $r$ and the side of the can is really just a rectangle that has been bent into a cylinder.)
\item Using the fact that $V = 33.6$, write $S$ as a function of $r$ and state its applied domain.
\item Use your graphing calculator to find the dimensions of the can which has minimal surface area.

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item $V = \pi r^{2}h$
\item $S = 2 \pi r^{2} + 2\pi r h$
\item $S(r) = 2\pi r^{2} + \frac{67.2}{r}, \;$  Domain $r > 0$
\item $r \approx 1.749\,$in. and $h \approx 3.498\,$in. 

\end{enumerate}
