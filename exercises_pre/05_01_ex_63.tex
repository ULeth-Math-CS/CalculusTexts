{Suppose a local vendor charges $\$2$ per hot dog and that the number of hot dogs sold per hour $x$ is given by $x(t) = -4t^2+20t+92$, where $t$ is the number of hours since $10$ AM, $0 \leq t \leq 4$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Find an expression for the revenue per hour $R$ as a function of $x$.
\item  Find and simplify $\left(R \circ x\right)(t)$.  What does this represent?
\item  What is the revenue per hour at noon?

\end{enumerate}}
{ \begin{enumerate}

\item  $R(x) = 2x$

\item  $\left(R \circ x \right)(t) =  -8t^2+40t+184$, $0 \leq t \leq 4$.  This gives the revenue per hour as a function of time.

\item  Noon corresponds to $t=2$, so $\left(R \circ x \right)(2) = 232$.  The hourly revenue at noon is $\$232$ per hour. 

\end{enumerate}}
