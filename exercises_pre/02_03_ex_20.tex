{In the situation of Example \ref{donniealpaca}, Donnie has a nightmare that one of his alpaca herd fell into the river and drowned.  To avoid this, he wants to move his rectangular pasture \textit{away} from the river.  This means that all four sides of the pasture require fencing.  If the total amount of fencing available is still 200 linear feet, what dimensions maximize the area of the pasture now?  What is the maximum area?  Assuming an average alpaca requires 25 square feet of pasture, how many alpaca can he raise now?}
{50 feet by 50 feet;  maximum area is 2500 feet;  he can raise 100 average alpacas. }
