{With the help of your classmates, show that the time it takes for $90 \%$ of each isotope listed in Exercises \ref{radioactivefirst} - \ref{radioactivelast} to decay does not depend on the initial amount of the substance, but rather, on only the decay constant $k$. Find a formula, in terms of $k$ only, to determine how long it takes for $90 \%$ of a radioactive isotope to decay. }
{$t = \frac{\ln(0.1)}{k} = -\frac{\ln(10)}{k}$}
