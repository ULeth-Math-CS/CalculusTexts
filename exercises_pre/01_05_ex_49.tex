{The daily cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ Sasquatch Berry Pies $C(x) = 3x + 36$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in  dollars per pie,  is $p(x) = 12-0.5x$, $0 \leq x \leq 24$.}
{\begin{itemize}

\item  $C(0) = 36$, so the daily fixed costs are $\$36$.

\item  $\overline{C}(10) = 6.6$, so when 10 pies are made, the cost per pie is $\$6.60$.

\item  $p(5) = 9.5$, so to sell $5$ pies a day, set the price at $\$9.50$  per pie.

\item $R(x) = -0.5 x^2 + 12x$, $0 \leq x \leq 24$

\item  $P(x) = -0.5 x^2+9x-36$, $0 \leq x \leq 24$

\item  $P(x) = 0$ when $x = 6$ and $x=12$.  These are the `break even' points, so selling $6$ pies or $12$ pies a day will guarantee the revenue earned exactly recoups the cost of production.
