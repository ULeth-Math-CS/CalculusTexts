{The cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ bottles of $100 \%$ All-Natural Certified Free-Trade Organic Sasquatch Tonic is $C(x) = 10x+100$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in dollars per bottle,  is $p(x) = 35 - x$, $0 \leq x \leq 35$.}
{ \begin{itemize}

\item   $P(x) = -x^2+25x-100$, for $0 \leq x \leq 35$

\item  Since the vertex occurs at $x=12.5$, and it is impossible to make or sell $12.5$ bottles of tonic, maximum profit occurs when either $12$ or $13$ bottles of tonic are made and sold.

\item  The maximum profit is $\$56$.

\item  The price per bottle can be either $\$23$ (to sell 12 bottles) or $\$22$ (to sell 13 bottles.)  Both will result in the maximum profit.

\item The break even points are $x=5$ and $x=20$, so to make a profit, between 5 and 20 bottles of tonic need to be made and sold.

\end{itemize}
