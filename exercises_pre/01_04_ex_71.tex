{The population of Sasquatch in Portage County can be modeled by the function $P(t) = \frac{150t}{t + 15}$, where $t$ represents the number of  years since 1803.  Find and interpret $P(0)$ and $P(205)$.  Discuss with your classmates what the applied domain and range of $P$ should be.\label{Sasquatchfunc1} }
{$P(0) = 0$ which means in 1803 ($0$ years after 1803), there are no Sasquatch in Portage County.  $P(205) = \frac{3075}{22} \approx 139.77$, so in 2008 ($205$ years after 1803), there were between 139 and 140 Sasquatch in Portage County.}
