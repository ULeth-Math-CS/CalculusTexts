{Suppose two electric point charges, one with charge $q$ and one with charge $Q$, are positioned $r$ units apart. The electrostatic force $F$ exerted on the charges varies directly with the product of the two charges and inversely with the square of the distance between the charges.\footnote{Note the similarity to this formula and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation as discussed in Example \ref{gravitylaw}.}  (This is \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic\#Coulomb.27s_law}{\underline{Coulomb's Law}}) \index{Coulomb's Law} }
{$F = \dfrac{kqQ}{r^2}$   }
