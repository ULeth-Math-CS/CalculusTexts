{The area $A$ enclosed by a square, in square inches,  is a function of the length of one of its sides $x$, when measured in inches.  This relation is expressed by the formula $A(x) = x^2$ for $x > 0$.  Find $A(3)$ and solve $A(x) = 36$.  Interpret your answers to each.  Why is $x$ restricted to $x > 0$?}
{$A(3) = 9$, so the area enclosed by a square with a side of length $3$ inches is $9$ square inches.  The solutions to $A(x) = 36$ are $x = \pm 6$.  Since $x$ is restricted to  $x > 0$, we only keep $x = 6$.  This means for the area enclosed by the square to be $36$ square inches, the length of the side needs to be $6$ inches.  Since $x$ represents a length, $x > 0$.}
