{A salesperson is paid \$200 per week plus 5\% commission on her weekly sales of $x$ dollars.  Find a linear function that represents her total weekly pay, $W$ (in dollars) in terms of $x$.  What must her weekly sales be in order for her to earn \$475.00 for the week?}
{$W(x) = 200 + .05x,\, x \geq 0\;\;$ She must make \$5500 in weekly sales.
