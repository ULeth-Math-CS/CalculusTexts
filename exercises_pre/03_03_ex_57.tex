{Let $f(x) = 5x^{7} - 33x^{6} + 3x^{5} - 71x^{4} - 597x^{3} + 2097x^{2} - 1971x + 567$.  With the help of your classmates, find the $x$- and $y$- intercepts of the graph of $f$.  Find the intervals on which the function is increasing, the intervals on which it is decreasing and the local extrema.  Sketch the graph of $f$, using more than one picture if necessary to show all of the important features of the graph.  }
