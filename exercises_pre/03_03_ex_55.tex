{In Example \ref{boxnotopex} in Section \ref{GraphsofPolynomials}, a box with no top is constructed from a $10$ inch $\times$ $12$ inch piece of cardboard by cutting out congruent squares from each corner of the cardboard and then folding the resulting tabs.  We determined the volume of that box (in cubic inches) is given by  $V(x) = 4x^3-44x^2+120x$, where $x$ denotes the length of the side of the square which is removed from each corner (in inches), $0 < x < 5$.  Solve the inequality $V(x) \geq 80$ analytically and interpret your answer in the context of that example.}
{$V(x) \geq 80$ on $[1,5-\sqrt{5}] \cup [5+\sqrt{5}, \infty)$.  Only the portion $[1,5-\sqrt{5}]$ lies in the applied domain, however.   In the context of the problem, this says for the volume of the box to be at least 80 cubic inches, the square removed from each corner needs to have a side length of at least 1 inch, but no more than $5-\sqrt{5} \approx 2.76$ inches.
