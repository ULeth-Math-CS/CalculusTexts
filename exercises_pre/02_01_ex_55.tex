{The temperature $T$ in degrees Fahrenheit $t$ hours after 6 AM is given by:

\[ T(t) = -\frac{1}{2} t^2 + 8t+32, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 12\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Find and interpret $T(4)$, $T(8)$ and $T(12)$.

\item  Find and interpret the average rate of change of $T$ over the interval $[4,8]$.

\item  Find and interpret the average rate of change of $T$ from $t=8$ to $t=12$.

\item  Find and interpret the average rate of temperature change between 10 AM and 6 PM.

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item  $T(4) = 56$, so at 10 AM (4 hours after 6 AM), it is $56^{\circ}$F.  $T(8) = 64$, so at 2 PM (8 hours after 6 AM), it is $64^{\circ}$F.  $T(12) = 56$, so at 6 PM (12 hours after 6 AM), it is $56^{\circ}$F.

\item  The average rate of change is $\frac{T(8)-T(4)}{8-4}=2$.  Between 10 AM and 2 PM, the temperature increases, on average, at a rate of $2^{\circ}$F per hour.

\item  The average rate of change is $\frac{T(12)-T(8)}{12-8}=-2$.  Between 2 PM and 6 PM, the temperature decreases, on average, at a rate of $2^{\circ}$F per hour.

\item  The average rate of change is $\frac{T(12)-T(4)}{12-4}=0$.  Between 10 AM and 6 PM, the temperature, on average, remains constant.
