{Show that a constant function $f$ is periodic by showing that $f(x + 117) = f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$. Then show that $f$ has no period by showing that you cannot find a \emph{smallest} number $p$ such that $f(x + p) = f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.  Said another way, show that $f(x + p) = f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$ for ALL values of $p > 0$, so no smallest value exists to satisfy the definition of `period'.}
