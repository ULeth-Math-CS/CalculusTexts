{Use a graphing utility to graph $y = P(x)$ and determine the number of TVs which should be sold to maximize profit.  What is the maximum  profit?
}
{The calculator gives the location  of the absolute maximum (rounded to three decimal places) as $x \approx 3.897$ and $y \approx 35.255$.  Since $x$ represents the number of TVs sold in hundreds, $x = 3.897$ corresponds to $389.7$ TVs.  Since we can't sell $0.7$ of a TV, we compare $P(3.89) \approx 35.254$ and $P(3.90) \approx 35.255$, so selling $390$ TVs results in a (slightly) higher revenue.  Since $y$ represents the revenue in \textit{thousands} of dollars, the maximum revenue is $\$ 35,\!255$.
