{In response to the economic forces in Exercise \ref{exerredoportaboy} above, the local retailer sets the selling price of a PortaBoy at \$250.  Remarkably, 30 units were sold each week.  When the systems went on sale for \$220, 40 units per week were sold.  Rework Examples \ref{PortaBoyDemand} and \ref{PortaBoyRevenue} with this new data.  What difficulties do you encounter?}
