{We mentioned earlier in the section that, in general, the order in which transformations are applied matters, yet in our first example with two transformations the order did not matter. (You could perform the shift to the left followed by the shift down or you could shift down and then left to achieve the same result.)  With the help of your classmates, determine the situations in which order does matter and those in which it does not.}
