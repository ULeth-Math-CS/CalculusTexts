{The temperature $T$ in degrees Fahrenheit $t$ hours after 6 AM is given by $T(t) = -\frac{1}{2} t^2 + 8t+3$ for $0 \leq t \leq 12$. Find and interpret $T(0)$, $T(6)$ and $T(12)$. }
{$T(0) = 3$, so at 6 AM ($0$ hours after 6 AM), it is $3^{\circ}$ Fahrenheit.  $T(6) = 33$, so at noon ($6$ hours after 6 AM), the temperature is $33^{\circ}$ Fahrenheit.  $T(12) = 27$, so at 6 PM ($12$ hours after 6 AM), it is $27^{\circ}$ Fahrenheit.}
