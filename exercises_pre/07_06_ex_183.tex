 {$\tan \left( 2\arcsin(x) \right)$ }
{ $\tan \left( 2\arcsin(x) \right) = \dfrac{2x\sqrt{1 - x^{2}}}{1 - 2x^{2}}$ for $x$ in $\left(-1, -\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \cup \left(-\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \cup \left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 1\right)$\footnote{The equivalence for $x = \pm 1$ can be verified independently of the derivation of the formula, but Calculus is required to fully understand what is happening at those $x$ values.  You'll see what we mean when you work through the details of the identity for $\tan(2t).$  For now, we exclude $x = \pm 1$ from our answer.}}
