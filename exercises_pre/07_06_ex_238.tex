{Use the following picture and series of exercises to show that 
\[\arctan(1) + \arctan(2) + \arctan(3) = \pi\]

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Clearly $\triangle AOB$ and $\triangle BCD$ are right triangles because the line through $O$ and $A$ and the line through $C$ and $D$ are perpendicular to the $x$-axis. Use the distance formula to show that $\triangle BAD$ is also a right triangle (with $\angle BAD$ being the right angle) by showing that the sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. 
 \item Use $\triangle AOB$ to show that $\alpha = \arctan(1)$ 
 \item Use $\triangle BAD$ to show that $\beta = \arctan(2)$ 
 \item Use $\triangle BCD$ to show that $\gamma = \arctan(3)$ \item Use the fact that $O$, $B$ and $C$ all lie on the $x$-axis to conclude that $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$. Thus $\arctan(1) + \arctan(2) + \arctan(3) = \pi$.
 \end{enumerate}}
