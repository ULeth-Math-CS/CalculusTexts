{The monthly cost, in \emph{hundreds} of dollars, to produce $x$ custom built electric scooters is $C(x) = 20x + 1000$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in \emph{hundreds} of dollars per scooter,  is $p(x) = 140-2x$, $0 \leq x \leq 70$.}
{\begin{itemize}

\item  $P(x) = -2x^2+120x-1000$, for $0 \leq x \leq 70$

\item  $30$ scooters need to be made and sold to maximize profit.

\item  The maximum monthly profit is $800$ hundred dollars, or $\$80,\!000$.

\item The price per scooter should be set at $80$ hundred dollars, or $\$8000$ per scooter.

\item  The break even points are $x=10$ and $x=50$, so to make a profit, between 10 and 50 scooters  need to be made and sold monthly.
