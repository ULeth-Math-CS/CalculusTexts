{Carbon-14 cannot be used to date inorganic material such as rocks, but there are many other methods of radiometric dating which estimate the age of rocks.  One of them, Rubidium-Strontium dating, uses Rubidium-87 which decays to Strontium-87 with a half-life of 50 billion years.  Use Equation \ref{radioactivedecay} to express the amount of Rubidium-87 left from an initial 2.3 micrograms as a function of time $t$ in \emph{billions} of years.  Research this and other radiometric techniques and discuss the margins of error for various methods with your classmates.}
