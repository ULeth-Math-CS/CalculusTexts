{A tree standing vertically on level ground casts a 120 foot long shadow.  The angle of elevation from the end of the shadow to the top of the tree is $21.4^{\circ}$.  Find the height of the tree to the nearest foot.  With the help of your classmates, research the term \emph{umbra versa} and see what it has to do with the shadow in this problem.}
