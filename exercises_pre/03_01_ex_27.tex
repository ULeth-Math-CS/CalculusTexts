{Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove that $f(x) = x^{3} - 9x + 5$ has a real zero in each of the following intervals: $[-4, -3], [0, 1]$ and $[2, 3]$.
}
{We have $f(-4)=-23,\; f(-3)=5,\; f(0)=5,\; f(1)=-3,\; f(2)=-5\;$ and $f(3)=5$ so the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that $f(x) = x^{3} - 9x + 5$ has real zeros in the intervals $[-4, -3], [0, 1]$ and $[2, 3]$.}
