{The temperature $T$, in degrees Fahrenheit, $t$ hours after 6 AM is given by $T(t) = -\frac{1}{2} t^2 + 8t+32$, for $0 \leq t \leq 12$.  When is it warmer than $42^{\circ}$ Fahrenheit?}
{ $T(t) > 42$ on  $(8-2\sqrt{11}, 8+2\sqrt{11}) \approx (1.37, 14.63)$, which corresponds to between 7:22 AM (1.37 hours after 6 AM) to 8:38 PM (14.63 hours after 6 AM.)  However, since the model is valid only for $t$, $0 \leq t \leq 12$, we restrict our answer and find it is warmer than $42^{\circ}$ Fahrenheit from 7:22 AM to 6 PM. }
