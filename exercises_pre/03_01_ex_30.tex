{Assume that the cost, in \textit{thousands} of dollars, to produce $x$ \textit{hundred} LCD TVs is given by $C(x) = 200x + 25$ for $x \geq 0$. Find and simplify an expression for the profit function $P(x)$.  (Remember: Profit = Revenue - Cost.)
}
{$P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = -5x^3+35x^2-45x-25$, $0 \leq x \leq 10.07$.
