{The monthly cost, in hundreds of dollars, to produce $x$ custom built electric scooters is $C(x) = 20x + 1000$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in  hundreds of dollars per scooter,  is $p(x) = 140-2x$, $0 \leq x \leq 70$.}
{ \begin{itemize}

\item  $C(0) = 1000$, so the monthly fixed costs are $1000$ \textit{hundred} dollars, or $\$100,\!000$.

\item  $\overline{C}(10) = 120$, so when 10 scooters are made, the cost per scooter is $120$ hundred dollars, or $\$12,\!000$.

\item  $p(5) = 130$, so to sell $5$ scooters a month, set the price at $130$ hundred dollars, or $\$13,\!000$ per scooter.

\item $R(x) = -2x^2+140x$, $0 \leq x \leq 70$

\item  $P(x) = -2x^2+120x-1000$, $0 \leq x \leq 70$

\item  $P(x) = 0$ when $x = 10$ and $x=50$.  These are the `break even' points, so selling $10$ scooters or $50$ scooters a month will guarantee the revenue earned exactly recoups the cost of production.
