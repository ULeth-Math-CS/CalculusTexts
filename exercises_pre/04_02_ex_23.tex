{Let $g(x) = \displaystyle \frac{x^{4} - 8x^{3} + 24x^{2} - 72x + 135}{x^{3} - 9x^{2} + 15x - 7}.\;$  With the help of your classmates, find the $x$- and $y$- intercepts of the graph of $g$.  Find the intervals on which the function is increasing, the intervals on which it is decreasing and the local extrema. Find all of the asymptotes of the graph of $g$ and any holes in the graph, if they exist.  Be sure to show all of your work including any polynomial or synthetic division.  Sketch the graph of $g$, using more than one picture if necessary to show all of the important features of the graph.}
