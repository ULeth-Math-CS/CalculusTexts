{The Cobb-Douglas production model states that the yearly total dollar value of the production output $P$ in an economy is a function of labour $x$ (the total number of hours worked in a year) and capital $y$ (the total dollar value of all of the stuff purchased in order to make things).  Specifically, $P = ax^{b}y^{1 - b}$.  By fixing $P$, we create what's known as an `isoquant' and we can then solve for $y$ as a function of $x$.  Let's assume that the Cobb-Douglas production model for the country of Sasquatchia is $P = 1.23x^{0.4}y^{0.6}$.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $P = 300$ and solve for $y$ in terms of $x$.  If $x = 100$, what is $y$?

\item Graph the isoquant $300 = 1.23x^{0.4}y^{0.6}$.  What information does an ordered pair $(x, y)$ which makes $P = 300$ give you?  With the help of your classmates, find several different combinations of labour and capital all of which yield $P = 300$.  Discuss any patterns you may see.

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item First rewrite the model as $P = 1.23x^{\frac{2}{5}}y^{\frac{3}{5}}$.  Then $300 = 1.23x^{\frac{2}{5}}y^{\frac{3}{5}}$ yields $y = \left( \dfrac{300}{1.23x^{\frac{2}{5}}} \right)^{\frac{5}{3}}$.  If $x = 100$ then $y \approx 441.93687$.
