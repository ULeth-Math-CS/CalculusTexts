{Consider the circle of radius $r$ pictured below with central angle $\theta$, measured in radians,  and subtended arc of length $s$.  Prove that the area of the shaded sector is $A = \frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta$. 

(Hint: Use the proportion  $\frac{A}{\text{area of the circle}} = \frac{s}{\text{circumference of the circle}}$.)
