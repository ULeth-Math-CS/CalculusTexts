{Carl's friend Jason participates in the Highland Games. In one event, the hammer throw, the height $h$ in feet of the hammer above the ground $t$ seconds after Jason lets it go is modeled by $h(t) = -16t^2 +  22.08t + 6$.  What is the hammer's maximum height?  What is the hammer's total time in the air? Round your answers to two decimal places.}
{The hammer reaches a maximum height of approximately $13.62$ feet.  The hammer is in the air approximately $1.61$ seconds.}
