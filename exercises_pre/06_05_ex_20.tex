{In Example \ref{cardepreciationex} in Section \ref{IntroExpLogs}, the exponential function $V(x) = 25 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{x}$ was used to model the value of a car over time.  Use the properties of logs and/or exponents to rewrite the model in the form $V(t) = 25e^{kt}$.}
{$V(t) = 25e^{\ln\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)t} \approx 25e^{-0.22314355t}$}
