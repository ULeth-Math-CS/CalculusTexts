{\label{piecewiseshipping} An on-line comic book retailer charges shipping costs according to the following formula \[{\displaystyle S(n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}  1.5 n + 2.5 & \mbox{ if } & 1 \leq n \leq 14  \\
                                                            0  & \mbox{ if } & n \geq 15
                                     \end{array} \right. }\]
                                     
where $n$ is the number of  comic books purchased and $S(n)$ is the shipping cost in dollars.
                                     
\begin{enumerate}

\item  What is the cost to ship 10 comic books?  %  Ans:  $S(10) = 17.5$, $\$ 17.50$.

\item  What is the significance of the formula $S(n) = 0$ for $n \geq 15$?   % Ans:  There is free shipping on orders of $15$ or more comic books. 
 
\end{enumerate}
}
{ \begin{enumerate}

\item  $S(10) = 17.5$, so it costs $\$ 17.50$ to ship 10 comic books.
