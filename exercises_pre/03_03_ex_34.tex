{Find the real zeros of $f(x) = x^{3} - \frac{1}{12}x^{2} - \frac{7}{72}x + \frac{1}{72}$ by first finding a polynomial $q(x)$ with integer coefficients such that $q(x) = N \cdot f(x)$ for some integer $N$.  (Recall that the Rational Zeros Theorem required the polynomial in question to have integer coefficients.) Show that $f$ and $q$ have the same real zeros.}
{We choose $q(x) = 72x^{3} - 6x^{2} - 7x + 1 = 72 \cdot f(x)$.  Clearly $f(x) = 0$ if and only if $q(x) = 0$ so they have the same real zeros.  In this case, $x = -\frac{1}{3}, \; x = \frac{1}{6} \;$ and $x = \frac{1}{4}$ are the real zeros of both $f$ and $q$.}
