{In Exercise \ref{Sasquatchfunc1} in Section \ref{FunctionNotation}, the population of Sasquatch in Portage County was modeled by the function \[P(t) = \frac{150t}{t + 15},\] where $t = 0$ represents the year 1803.  Find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of $y = P(t)$ and explain what it means.}
{The horizontal asymptote of the graph of $P(t) = \frac{150t}{t + 15}$ is $y = 150$ and it means that the model predicts the population of Sasquatch in Portage County will never exceed 150.}
