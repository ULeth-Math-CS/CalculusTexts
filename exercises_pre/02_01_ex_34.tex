{The Topology Taxi Company charges $\$2.50$ for the first fifth of a mile and $\$0.45$ for each additional fifth of a mile.  Find a linear function which models the taxi fare $F$ as a function of the number of miles driven, $m$.  Interpret the slope of the linear function and find and interpret $F(0)$.}
{$F(m) = 2.25m + 2.05 \;$  The slope $2.25$ means it costs an additional $\$2.25$ for each mile beyond the first 0.2 miles.  $F(0) = 2.05$, so according to the model, it would cost $\$2.05$ for a trip of $0$ miles.  Would this ever really happen?  Depends on the driver and the passenger, we suppose.}
