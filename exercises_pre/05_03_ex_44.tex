{\label{pursuitfurther} Suppose Fritzy the Fox, positioned at a point $(x,y)$ in the first quadrant, spots Chewbacca the Bunny at $(0,0)$.   Chewbacca begins to run along a fence (the positive $y$-axis) towards his warren.  Fritzy, of course, takes chase and constantly adjusts his direction so that he is always running directly at Chewbacca.  If Chewbacca's speed is $v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}$ and  Fritzy's speed is $v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}$, the path Fritzy will take to intercept Chewbacca, provided $v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}$ is directly proportional to, but not equal to, $v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}$ is modelled by

\[ y = \dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{x^{1+ v_{1}/v_{2}}}{1+v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}/v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}}- \dfrac{x^{1-v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}/v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}}}{1-v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}/v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}}\right) + \dfrac{v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}} v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}}{v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}^2-v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}^2} \]

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Determine the path that Fritzy will take if he runs exactly twice as fast as Chewbacca;  that is, $v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}} = 2v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}$. Use your calculator to graph this path for $x \geq 0$.  What is the significance of the $y$-intercept of the graph?

\item  Determine the path Fritzy will take if Chewbacca runs exactly twice as fast as he does;  that is, $v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}} = 2v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}$.  Use your calculator to graph this path for $x > 0$.  Describe the behaviour of $y$ as $x \rightarrow 0^{+}$ and interpret this physically.

\item  With the help of your classmates, generalize parts (a) and (b) to two cases:  $v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}} > v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}$ and $v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}} < v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}}$.   We will discuss the case of $v_{\mbox{\tiny$1$}} = v_{\mbox{\tiny$2$}}$ in Exercise \ref{pursuitlog} in Section \ref{ExpLogApplications}.

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item  $y = \frac{1}{3}x^{3/2} - \sqrt{x} + \frac{2}{3}$.  The point $\left(0,\frac{2}{3}\right)$ is when Fritzy's path crosses Chewbacca's path - in other words, where Fritzy catches Chewbacca.

\item $y = \frac{1}{6}x^3+\frac{1}{2x} - \frac{2}{3}$.  Using the techniques from Chapter \ref{Rationals}, we find as $x \rightarrow 0^{+}$, $y \rightarrow \infty$ which means, in this case, Fritzy's pursuit never ends;  he never catches Chewbacca. This makes sense since Chewbacca has a head start and is running faster than Fritzy.
