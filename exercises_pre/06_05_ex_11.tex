{Jeff's bank also offers a 36-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) with an APR of $2.25\%$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item If $P = 2000$ what is $A(8)$?
\item Solve the equation $A(t) = 4000$ for $t$.
\item What principal $P$ should be invested so that the account balance is \$2000 in three years?
\item The Annual Percentage Yield is the \underline{simple} interest rate that returns the same amount of interest after one year as the compound interest does.  With the help of your classmates, compute the APY for this investment.

\end{enumerate}}
{ \begin{enumerate}

\item $A(8) = 2000\left(1 + \frac{0.0225}{12}\right)^{12 \cdot 8} \approx \$2394.03$
\item $t = \dfrac{\ln(2)}{12 \ln\left(1 + \frac{0.0225}{12}\right)} \approx 30.83$ years
\item $P = \dfrac{2000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.0225}{12}\right)^{36}} \approx \$1869.57$
\item $\left(1 + \frac{0.0225}{12}\right)^{12} \approx 1.0227$ so the APY is 2.27\%

\end{enumerate}}
