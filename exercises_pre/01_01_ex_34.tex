{Let's assume for a moment that we are standing at the origin and the positive $y$-axis points due North while the positive $x$-axis points due East.  Our Sasquatch-o-meter tells us that Sasquatch is 3 miles West and 4 miles South of our current position.  What are the coordinates of his position?  How far away is he from us?  If he runs 7 miles due East what would his new position be?}
{$(-3, -4)$, $5$ miles, $(4, -4)$}
