{On May, 31, 2009, the Annual Percentage Rate listed at Jeff's bank for regular savings accounts was $0.25\%$ compounded monthly.  Use Equation \ref{compoundinterest} to answer the following.

\begin{enumerate}

\item If $P = 2000$ what is $A(8)$?
\item Solve the equation $A(t) = 4000$ for $t$.
\item What principal $P$ should be invested so that the account balance is \$2000 is three years?

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item $A(8) = 2000\left(1 + \frac{0.0025}{12}\right)^{12 \cdot 8} \approx \$2040.40$
\item $t = \dfrac{\ln(2)}{12 \ln\left(1 + \frac{0.0025}{12}\right)} \approx 277.29$ years
\item $P = \dfrac{2000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.0025}{12}\right)^{36}} \approx \$1985.06$

\end{enumerate}}
