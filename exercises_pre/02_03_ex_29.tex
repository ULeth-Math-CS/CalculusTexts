{Let $L$ be the line $y = 2x+1$.  Find a function $D(x)$ which measures the distance \textit{squared} from a point on $L$ to $(0,0)$.  Use this to find the point on $L$ closest to $(0,0)$.}
{$D(x) = x^2 + (2x+1)^2 = 5x^2+4x+1$,  $D$ is minimized when $x=-\frac{2}{5}$, so the point on $y=2x+1$ closest to $(0,0)$ is $\left(-\frac{2}{5}, \frac{1}{5}\right)$}
