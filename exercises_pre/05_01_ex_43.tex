{What linear functions could be used to transform $f(x) = x^{3}$ into $F(x) = -\frac{1}{2}(2x - 7)^{3} + 1$?  What is the proper order of composition?}
{One possible solution is $F(x) = -\frac{1}{2}(2x - 7)^{3} + 1 = k(j(f(h(g(x)))))$ where $g(x) = 2x, \, h(x) = x - 7, \, j(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x$ and $k(x) = x + 1$.  You could also have $F(x) = H(f(G(x)))$ where $G(x) = 2x - 7$ and $H(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x + 1$.}
