{Using data from \href{http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_23.html}{\underline{Bureau of Transportation Statistics}}, the average fuel economy $F$ in miles per gallon for passenger cars in the US can be modelled by  $F(t) = -0.0076t^2+0.45t + 16$, $0 \leq t \leq 28$, where $t$ is the number of years since $1980$. Find and interpret the coordinates of the vertex of the graph of $y = F(t)$.}
{The vertex is (approximately) $(29.60, 22.66)$, which corresponds to a maximum fuel economy of 22.66 miles per gallon, reached sometime between 2009 and 2010 (29 -- 30 years after 1980.)  Unfortunately, the model is only valid up until 2008 (28 years after 1908.)  So, at this point, we are using the model to \textit{predict} the maximum fuel economy.}
