{\label{explogsappcircuitone} The current $i$ measured in amps in a certain electronic circuit with a constant impressed voltage of 120 volts is given by $i(t) = 2 - 2e^{-10t}$ where $t \geq 0$ is the number of seconds after the circuit is switched on.  Determine the value of $i$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.  (This is called the \sword{steady state} current.)}
{ The steady state current is 2 amps.}
