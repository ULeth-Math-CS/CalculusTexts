{One of the most important aspects of the Cartesian Coordinate Plane is its ability to put Algebra into geometric terms and Geometry into algebraic terms.  We've spent most of this chapter looking at this very phenomenon and now you should spend some time with your classmates reviewing what we've done.  What major results do we have that tie Algebra and Geometry together?  What concepts from Geometry have we not yet described algebraically?  What topics from Intermediate Algebra have we not yet discussed geometrically? }
