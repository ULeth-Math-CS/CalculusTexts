{The box for the new Sasquatch-themed cereal, `Crypt-Os', is to have a volume of $140$ cubic inches.  For aesthetic reasons, the height of the box needs to be $1.62$ times the width of the base of the box.\footnote{1.62 is a crude approximation of the so-called `Golden Ratio' $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.}  Find the dimensions of the box which will minimize the surface area of the box.  What is the minimum surface area?  Round your answers to two decimal places. }
{The width of the base of the box should be $\approx 4.12$ inches, the height of the box should be $\approx 6.67$ inches, and the depth of the base of the box should be $\approx 5.09$ inches;  minimum surface area $\approx 164.91$ square inches.
