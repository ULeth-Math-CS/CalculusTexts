{\label{fixedareaminperimetergarden} Sally is Skippy's neighbour from Exercise \ref{fixedperimetermaxareagarden} in Section \ref{QuadraticFunctions}.   Sally also wants to plant a vegetable garden along the side of her home.  She doesn't have any fencing, but wants to keep the size of the garden to 100 square feet.  What are the dimensions of the garden which will minimize the amount of fencing she needs to buy?  What is the minimum amount of fencing she needs to buy? Round your answers to the nearest foot. (Note:  Since one side of the garden will border the house, Sally doesn't need fencing along that side.)}
{The dimensions are  $\approx 7$ feet by $\approx 14$ feet;  minimum amount of fencing required $\approx 28$ feet.}
