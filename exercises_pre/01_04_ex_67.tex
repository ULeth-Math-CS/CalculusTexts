{The height of an object dropped from the roof of an eight story building is modeled by:  $h(t) = -16t^2 + 64$, $0 \leq t \leq 2$. Here,  $h$ is the height of the object off the ground, in feet, $t$ seconds after the object is dropped.  Find $h(0)$ and solve $h(t) = 0$.  Interpret your answers to each.  Why is $t$ restricted to $0 \leq t \leq 2$?}
{$h(0) = 64$, so at the moment the object is dropped off the building, the object is $64$ feet off of the ground.  The solutions to $h(t) = 0$ are $t = \pm 2$.  Since we restrict $0 \leq t \leq 2$, we only keep $t = 2$.  This means $2$ seconds after the object is dropped off the building, it is $0$ feet off the ground.  Said differently, the object hits the ground after $2$ seconds.  The restriction  $0 \leq t \leq 2$ restricts the time to be between the moment the object is released and the moment it hits the ground.}
