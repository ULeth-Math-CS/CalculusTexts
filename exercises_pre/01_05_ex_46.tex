{The cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ ``I'd rather be a Sasquatch'' T-Shirts is $C(x) = 2x+26$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in dollars per shirt,  is $p(x) = 30 - 2x$, $0 \leq x \leq 15$. }
{\begin{itemize}

\item  $C(0) = 26$, so the fixed costs are $\$26$.

\item  $\overline{C}(10) = 4.6$, so when 10 shirts are produced, the cost per shirt is $\$4.60$.

\item  $p(5) = 20$, so to sell $5$ shirts, set the price at $\$20$ per shirt.

\item $R(x) = -2x^2+30x$, $0 \leq x \leq 15$

\item  $P(x) = -2x^2+28x-26$, $0 \leq x \leq 15$

\item  $P(x) = 0$ when $x = 1$ and $x=13$.  These are the `break even' points, so selling $1$ shirt or $13$ shirts will guarantee the revenue earned exactly recoups the cost of production.

\end{itemize}
