{Use Equation \ref{compoundinterest} to show that the time it takes for an investment to double in value does \underline{not} depend on the principal $P$, but rather, depends only on the APR and the number of compoundings per year.  Let $n = 12$ and with the help of your classmates compute the doubling time for a variety of rates $r$.  Then look up the Rule of 72 and compare your answers to what that rule says.  If you're really interested (pun intended!) in Financial Mathematics, you could also compare and contrast the Rule of 72 with the Rule of 70 and the Rule of 69.}
