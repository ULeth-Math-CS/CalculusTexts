{Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the two acute angles of a right triangle.  (Thus $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complementary angles.)  Show that $\sin(\alpha) = \cos(\beta)$ and $\sin(\beta) = \cos(\alpha)$.  The fact that co-functions of complementary angles are equal in this case is not an accident and a more general result will be given in Section \ref{Identities}.
