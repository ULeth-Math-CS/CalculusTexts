{Using data from \href{http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_23.html}{\underline{Bureau of Transportation Statistics}}, the average fuel economy $F$ in miles per gallon for passenger cars in the US can be modeled by  $F(t) = -0.0076t^2+0.45t + 16$, $0 \leq t \leq 28$, where $t$ is the number of years since $1980$. Find and interpret the average rate of change of $F$ over the interval $[0,28]$.}
{The average rate of change is $\frac{F(28) - F(0)}{28-0}=0.2372$.  During the years from 1980 to 2008, the average fuel economy of passenger cars in the US increased, on average, at a rate of $0.2372$ miles per gallon per year.}
