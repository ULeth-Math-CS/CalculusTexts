{A right cylindrical drum is to hold 7.35 cubic feet of liquid.  Find the dimensions (radius of the base and height) of the drum which would minimize the surface area.  What is the minimum surface area?  Round your answers to two decimal places.}
{The radius of the drum should be $\approx 1.05$ feet and the height of the drum should be $\approx 2.12$ feet.  The minimum surface area of the drum is $\approx 20.93$ cubic feet.}
