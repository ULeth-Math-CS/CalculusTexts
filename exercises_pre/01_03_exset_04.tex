{\noindent The process given in Example \ref{introfunctionlastexample} for determining whether an equation of a relation represents $y$ as a function of $x$ breaks down if we cannot solve the equation for $y$ in terms of $x$.  However, that does not prevent us from proving that an equation fails to represent $y$ as a function of $x$.  What we really need is two points with the same $x$-coordinate and different $y$-coordinates which both satisfy the equation so that the graph of the relation would fail the Vertical Line Test \ref{VLT}.  Discuss with your classmates how you might find such points for the relations given in Exercises}
