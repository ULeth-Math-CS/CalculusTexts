{For many common functions, the properties of Algebra make a horizontal scaling the same as a vertical scaling by (possibly) a different factor.  For example, we stated earlier that $\sqrt{9x} = 3\sqrt{x}$.  With the help of your classmates, find the equivalent vertical scaling produced by the horizontal scalings $y = (2x)^{3}, \, y = |5x|, \, y = \sqrt[3]{27x} \, $ and $\, y = \left(\frac{1}{2} x\right)^{2}$.  What about $y = (-2x)^{3}, \, y = |-5x|, \, y = \sqrt[3]{-27x}\, $ and $\, y = \left(-\frac{1}{2} x\right)^{2}$?}
