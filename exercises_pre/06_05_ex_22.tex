{The diameter $D$ of a tumour, in millimetres, $t$ days after it is detected is given by:  \[D(t) = 15e^{0.0277t} \]

\begin{enumerate}

\item  What was the diameter of the tumour when it was originally detected?

\item  How long until the diameter of the tumour doubles?

\end{enumerate}}
{ \begin{enumerate} \item $D(0) = 15$, so the tumour was 15 millimetres in diameter when it was first detected.

\item  $t = \frac{\ln(2)}{0.0277} \approx 25$ days.

\end{enumerate}}
