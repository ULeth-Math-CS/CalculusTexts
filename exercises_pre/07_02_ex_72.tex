{A passenger on the Big Wheel in Exercise \ref{giantwheelmotion} from Section \ref{Angles}.

Recall: The diameter is 128 feet and completes 2 revolutions in 2 minutes, 7 seconds.}
{$r = 64$ feet, $\omega = \frac{4\pi}{127} \, \frac{\text{radians}}{\text{second}}$,  $x = 64 \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{127} \, t \right)$, $y = 64 \sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{127} \, t \right)$.  Here $x$ and $y$ are measured in feet and $t$ is measured in seconds.}
