{A point on the edge of the hard drive in Exercise \ref{harddrive} from Section \ref{Angles}.

Recall:  The diameter of the hard disk is 2.5 inches and it spins at 7200 revolutions per minute.}
{$r = 1.25$ inches, $\omega = 14400 \pi \, \frac{\text{radians}}{\text{minute}}$,  $x = 1.25 \cos(14400 \pi \, t)$, $y = 1.25 \sin(14400 \pi \, t)$.  Here $x$ and $y$ are measured in inches and $t$ is measured in minutes.}
