{With the help of your classmates, find examples of equations whose graphs possess 

\begin{itemize}

\item  symmetry about the $x$-axis only

\item  symmetry about the $y$-axis only

\item  symmetry about the origin only

\item  symmetry about the $x$-axis, $y$-axis, and origin

\end{itemize}

Can you find an example of an equation whose graph possesses exactly \textit{two} of the symmetries listed above?  Why or why not?
