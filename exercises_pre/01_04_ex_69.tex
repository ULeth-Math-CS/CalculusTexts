{The function $C(x) = x^2-10x+27$  models the cost, in \textit{hundreds} of dollars, to produce $x$ \textit{thousand} pens.  Find and interpret $C(0)$, $C(2)$ and $C(5)$.

(The value $C(0)$ is called the `fixed' or `start-up' cost.  We'll revisit this concept on page \pageref{pricerevenuecostprofit}.) }
{$C(0) = 27$, so to make $0$ pens, it costs $\$ 2700$.  $C(2) = 11$, so to make $2000$ pens, it costs $\$1100$.  $C(5) = 2$, so to make $5000$ pens, it costs $\$2000$.}
