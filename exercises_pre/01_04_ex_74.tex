{\label{piecewisemobile} The cost $C$ (in dollars) to talk $m$ minutes a month on a mobile phone plan is modeled by   \[{\displaystyle C(m) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} 25 & \mbox{ if } & 0 \leq m \leq 1000 \\
                                                            25+0.1(m-1000) & \mbox{ if } & m > 1000
                                     \end{array} \right. }\]
                                     
\begin{enumerate}

\item  How much does it cost to talk $750$ minutes per month with this plan?  % Ans:  $C(750) = 25$, $\$ 25$.

\item  How much does it cost to talk $20$ hours a month with this plan?  % Ans:  $C(1200) = 45$, $\$ 45$. 

\item  Explain the terms of the plan verbally.  % Ans:  It costs $\$25$ for up to $1000$ minutes and $10$ cents per minute for each minute over $1000$ minutes.
 
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item  $C(750) = 25$, so it costs $\$ 25$ to talk 750 minutes per month with this plan.

\item  Since $20 \, \text{hours} = 1200 \, \text{minutes}$, we substitute $m = 1200$ and get  $C(1200) = 45$.  It costs $\$ 45$ to talk 20 hours per month with this plan. 

\item It costs $\$25$ for up to $1000$ minutes and $10$ cents per minute for each minute over $1000$ minutes.
