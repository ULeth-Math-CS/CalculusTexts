{In Exercise \ref{newportaboycost}, the function $C(x) = .03x^{3} - 4.5x^{2} + 225x + 250$, for $x \geq 0$ was used to model the cost (in dollars) to produce $x$ PortaBoy game systems. Using this cost function, find the number of PortaBoys which should be produced to minimize the average cost $\overline{C}$.  Round your answer to the nearest number of systems. }
{The absolute minimum of $y=\overline{C}(x)$ occurs at $\approx (75.73, 59.57)$.  Since $x$ represents the number of game systems, we check $\overline{C}(75) \approx 59.58$ and $\overline{C}(76) \approx 59.57$.  Hence, to minimize the average cost, $76$ systems should be produced at an average cost of $\$59.57$ per system.}
