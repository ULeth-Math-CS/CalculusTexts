{The cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ ``I'd rather be a Sasquatch'' T-Shirts is $C(x) = 2x+26$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in dollars per shirt,  is $p(x) = 30 - 2x$, $0 \leq x \leq 15$.}
{\begin{itemize}

\item $P(x) = -2x^2+28x-26$, for $0 \leq x \leq 15$.

\item $7$ T-shirts should be made and  sold to maximize profit. 

\item The maximum profit is $\$72$. 

\item The price per T-shirt should be set at $\$16$ to maximize profit. 

\item The break even points are $x=1$ and $x=13$, so to make a profit, between 1 and 13 T-shirts need to be made and sold.

\end{itemize}
