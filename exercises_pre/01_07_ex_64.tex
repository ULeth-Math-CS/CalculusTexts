{The graph of $y = f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$ is given immediately below, and the graph of $y = g(x)$ is given below that of $y=f(x)$. Find a formula for $g$ based on transformations of the graph of $f$.  Check your answer by confirming that the points shown on the graph of $g$ satisfy the equation $y = g(x)$.
