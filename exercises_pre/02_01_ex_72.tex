{\label{inversemidpointex2} Show that if  $a \neq b$, the line containing the points $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ is perpendicular to the line $y = x$. (Coupled with the result from Example \ref{inversemidpointex1} on page \pageref{inversemidpoint}, we have now shown that the line $y = x$ is a \textit{perpendicular} bisector of the line segment connecting $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$.  This means the points $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ are symmetric about the line $y = x$.  We will revisit this symmetry in section \ref{InverseFunctions}.) }
