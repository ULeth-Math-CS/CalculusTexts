{A finance company offers a promotion on $\$5000$ loans.  The borrower does not have to make any payments for the first three years, however interest will continue to be charged to the loan at $29.9 \%$ compounded continuously.  What amount will be due at the end of the three year period, assuming no payments are made?  If the promotion is extended an additional three years, and no payments are made, what amount would be due?}
{$A(3) = 5000e^{0.299 \cdot 3} \approx \$12,226.18$,  $A(6) = 5000e^{0.299 \cdot 6} \approx \$30,067.29$}
