{A plumber charges $\$50$ for a service call plus $\$80$ per hour.  If she spends no longer than 8 hours a day at any one site, find a linear function that represents her total daily charges $C$ (in dollars) as a function of time $t$ (in hours) spent at any one given location.}
{ $C(t) = 80t + 50$,  $0 \leq t \leq 8$}
