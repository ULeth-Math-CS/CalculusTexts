{Using Example \ref{tame} as a guide, show that the function $g$ whose graph is given below does \underline{not} have a local maximum at $(-3, 5)$ nor does it have a local minimum at $(3, -3)$.  Find its extrema, both local and absolute.  What's unique about the point $(0, -4)$ on this graph?  Also find the intervals on which $g$ is increasing and those on which $g$ is decreasing.
