{Using data from the  \href{http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_23.html}{\underline{Bureau of Transportation Statistics}}, the average fuel economy $F$ in miles per gallon for passenger cars in the US can be modelled by  $F(t) = -0.0076t^2+0.45t + 16$, $0 \leq t \leq 28$, where $t$ is the number of years since $1980$. Use your calculator to find $F(0)$, $F(14)$ and $F(28)$.  Round your answers to two decimal places and interpret your answers to each. }
{$F(0) = 16.00$, so in 1980 ($0$ years after 1980), the average fuel economy of passenger cars in the US was $16.00$ miles per gallon.  $F(14) = 20.81$, so in 1994 ($14$ years after 1980), the average fuel economy of passenger cars in the US was $20.81$ miles per gallon.  $F(28) = 22.64$, so in 2008 ($28$ years after 1980), the average fuel economy of passenger cars in the US was $22.64$ miles per gallon.}
