{Let $f(x) = \dfrac{2x}{x^2-1}$.  Using the techniques in Section \ref{RationalGraphs}, graph $y=f(x)$.  Verify that $f$ is one-to-one on the interval $(-1,1)$.  Use the procedure outlined on Page \pageref{inverseprocedure} and your graphing calculator to find the formula for $f^{-1}(x)$.  Note that since $f(0) = 0$, it should be the case that $f^{-1}(0) = 0$.  What goes wrong when you attempt to substitute $x=0$ into $f^{-1}(x)$?  Discuss with your classmates how this problem arose and possible remedies.}
