{From Exercise \ref{newportaboycost} in Section \ref{GraphsofPolynomials}, $C(x) = .03x^{3} - 4.5x^{2} + 225x + 250$, for $x \geq 0$ models the cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ PortaBoy game systems. If the production budget is $\$5000$, find the number of game systems which can be produced and still remain under budget.}
{$C(x) \leq 5000$ on (approximately) $(-\infty, 82.18]$.  The portion of this which lies in the applied domain is $(0,82.18]$.  Since $x$ represents the number of game systems, we check $C(82) = 4983.04$ and $C(83) = 5078.11$, so to remain within the production budget, anywhere between $1$ and $82$ game systems can be produced.
