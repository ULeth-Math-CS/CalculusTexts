{Suppose $C(x) = x^2-10x+27$ represents the costs, in \textit{hundreds}, to produce $x$ \textit{thousand} pens.  Find and interpret the average rate of change as production is increased from making 3000 to 5000 pens.}
{The average rate of change is $\frac{C(5)-C(3)}{5-3}=-2$.  As production is increased from 3000 to 5000 pens, the cost decreases at an average rate of  $\$200$ per 1000 pens produced (20\textcent \, per pen.)}
