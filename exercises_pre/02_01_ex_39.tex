{A local pizza store offers medium two-topping pizzas delivered for $\$6.00$ per pizza plus a $\$1.50$ delivery charge per order.  On weekends, the store runs a `game day' special:  if six or more medium two-topping pizzas are ordered, they are $\$5.50$ each with no delivery charge.  Write a piecewise-defined linear function which calculates the cost $C$ (in dollars) of  $p$ medium two-topping pizzas delivered during a weekend.}
{${\displaystyle C(p) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} 6p + 1.5 & \mbox{ if } & 1 \leq p \leq 5 \\
                                                            5.5p & \mbox{ if } & p\geq 6
                                     \end{array} \right. }$
