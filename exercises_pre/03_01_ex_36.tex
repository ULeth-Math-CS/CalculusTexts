{Here are a few other questions for you to discuss with your classmates.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item How many local extrema could a polynomial of degree $n$ have?  How few local extrema can it have?
\item Could a polynomial have two local maxima but no local minima?  
\item If a polynomial has two local maxima and two local minima, can it be of odd degree?  Can it be of even degree?
\item Can a polynomial have local extrema without having any real zeros?
\item Why must every polynomial of odd degree have at least one real zero?
\item Can a polynomial have two distinct real zeros and no local extrema?
\item Can an $x$-intercept yield a local extrema?  Can it yield an absolute extrema?
\item If the $y$-intercept yields an absolute minimum, what can we say about the degree of the polynomial and the sign of the leading coefficient?   

\end{enumerate}
