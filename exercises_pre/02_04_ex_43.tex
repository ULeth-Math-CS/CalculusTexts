{The surface area $S$ of a cube with edge length $x$ is given by $S(x) = 6x^{2}$ for $x > 0$.  Suppose the cubes your company manufactures are supposed to have a surface area of exactly 42 square centimetres, but the machines you own are old and cannot always make a cube with the precise surface area desired.  Write an inequality using absolute value that says the surface area of a given cube is no more than 3 square centimetres away (high or low) from the target of 42 square centimetres.  Solve the inequality and write your answer using interval notation.}
{Solving $|S(x) - 42| \leq 3$, and disregarding the negative solutions yields $\left[\sqrt{\frac{13}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}}\right] \approx [2.550, 2.739]$.  The edge length must be within $2.550$ and $2.739$ centimetres.}
