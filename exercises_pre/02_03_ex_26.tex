{\label{parabolicbridgecable} The two towers of a suspension bridge are 400 feet apart.  The parabolic cable\footnote{The weight of the bridge deck forces the bridge cable into a parabola and a free hanging cable such as a power line forms not a parabola, but a \sword{catenary}, a curve that is defined using exponential functions.} attached to the tops of the towers is 10 feet above the point on the bridge deck that is midway between the towers.  If the towers are 100 feet tall, find the height of the cable directly above a point of the bridge deck that is 50 feet to the right of the left-hand tower.}
{ Make the vertex of the parabola $(0, 10)$ so that the point on the top of the left-hand tower where the cable connects is $(-200, 100)$ and the point on the top of the right-hand tower is $(200, 100)$.  Then the parabola is given by $p(x) = \frac{9}{4000}x^{2} + 10$.  Standing $50$ feet to the right of the left-hand tower means you're standing at $x= -150$ and $p(-150) = 60.625$.  So the cable is 60.625 feet above the bridge deck there.}
