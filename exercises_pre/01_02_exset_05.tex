{\noindent For each equation given in Exercises}
{, (a) Find the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the graph, if any exist; (b) Follow the procedure in Example \ref{firstequgraph} to create a table of sample points on the graph of the equation; (c) Plot the sample points and create a rough sketch of the graph of the equation; Test for symmetry.  If the equation appears to fail any of the symmetry tests, find a point on the graph of the equation whose reflection fails to be on the graph as was done at the end of Example \ref{secondequgraph}.}
