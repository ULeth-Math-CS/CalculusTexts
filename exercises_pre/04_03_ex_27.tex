{Suppose we are in the same situation as Example \ref{boxnotopfixedvolume}.  If the volume of the box is to be $500$ cubic centimetres, use your calculator or computer to find the dimensions of the box which minimize the surface area.  What is the minimum surface area?  Round your answers to two decimal places.}
{The width (and depth) should be $10.00$ centimetres, the height should be $5.00$ centimetres.  The minimum surface area is $300.00$ square centimetres.}
