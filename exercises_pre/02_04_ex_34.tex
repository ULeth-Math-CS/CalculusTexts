{Suppose $C(x) = x^2-10x+27$, $x \geq 0$ represents the costs, in \textit{hundreds} of dollars, to produce $x$ \textit{thousand} pens.  Find the number of pens which can be produced for no more than $\$1100$.}
{$C(x) \leq 11$ on $[2,8]$.  This means anywhere between 2000 and 8000 pens can be produced and the cost will not exceed $\$1100$.}
