{\label{newportaboycost} While developing their newest game, Sasquatch Attack!, the makers of the PortaBoy (from Example \ref{PortaBoyCost}) revised their cost function and now use $C(x) = .03x^{3} - 4.5x^{2} + 225x + 250$, for $x \geq 0$. As before, $C(x)$ is the cost to make $x$ PortaBoy Game Systems.  Market research indicates that the demand function $p(x) = -1.5x + 250$ remains unchanged.  Use a graphing utility to find the production level $x$ that maximizes the \textit{profit} made by producing and selling $x$ PortaBoy game systems.

{Making and selling 71 PortaBoys yields a maximized profit of \$5910.67.
