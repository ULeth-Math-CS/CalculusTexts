{\label{yoyotrick} In the yo-yo trick `Around the World,' the performer throws the yo-yo so it sweeps out a vertical circle whose radius is the yo-yo string. If the yo-yo string is 28 inches long and the yo-yo takes 3 seconds to complete one revolution of the circle, compute the speed of the yo-yo in miles per hour.  Round your answer to two decimal places.}
{About 3.33 miles per hour}
