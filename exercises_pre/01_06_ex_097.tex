{Consider the graph of the function $f$ given below.  

\begin{center}
\myincludegraphics{figures/RelationsandFunctionsGraphics/GraphsofFunctions-11}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that $f$ has a local maximum but not a local minimum at the point $(-1, 1)$.

\item Show that $f$ has a local minimum but not a local maximum at the point $(1, 1)$.

\item Show that $f$ has a local maximum AND a local minimum at the point $(0, 1)$.

\item Show that $f$ is constant on the interval $[-1, 1]$ and thus has both a local maximum AND a local minimum at every point $(x, f(x))$ where $-1 < x < 1$.

\end{enumerate} }
