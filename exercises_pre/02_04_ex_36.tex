{The height $h$ in feet of a model rocket above the ground $t$ seconds after lift-off is given by $h(t) = -5t^2+100t$, for $0 \leq t \leq 20$. When is the rocket at least $250$ feet off the ground? Round your answer to two decimal places.}
{$h(t) \geq 250$ on $[10-5\sqrt{2}, 10+5\sqrt{2}] \approx [2.93, 17.07]$.  This means the rocket is at least 250 feet off the ground between 2.93 and 17.07 seconds after lift off. }
