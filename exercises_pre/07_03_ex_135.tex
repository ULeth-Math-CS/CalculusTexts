{We wish to establish the inequality $\cos(\theta) < \dfrac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} < 1$ for $0 < \theta < \dfrac{\pi}{2}.$  Use the diagram from the beginning of the section, partially reproduced below, to answer the following.

\begin{center}
\myincludegraphics{figures/IntroTrigGraphics/CircularFunctions-16}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that triangle $OPB$ has area $\dfrac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)$.
\item Show that the circular sector $OPB$ with central angle $\theta$ has area $\dfrac{1}{2} \theta$.
\item Show that triangle $OQB$ has area $\dfrac{1}{2} \tan(\theta)$.
\item Comparing areas, show that $\sin(\theta) < \theta < \tan(\theta)$ for $0 < \theta < \dfrac{\pi}{2}.$ 
\item Use the inequality $\sin(\theta) < \theta$ to show that $\dfrac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} < 1$ for $0 < \theta < \dfrac{\pi}{2}.$
\item Use the inequality $\theta < \tan(\theta)$ to show that $\cos(\theta) < \dfrac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta}$ for $0 < \theta < \dfrac{\pi}{2}.$  Combine this with the previous part to complete the proof.

\end{enumerate}}
