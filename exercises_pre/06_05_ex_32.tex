{\label{pursuitlog} In reference to Exercise \ref{pursuitfurther} in Section \ref{AlgebraicFunctions}, if Fritzy the Fox's speed is the same as Chewbacca the Bunny's speed, Fritzy's pursuit curve is given by

\[y(x) = \frac{1}{4} x^2-\frac{1}{4} \ln(x)-\frac{1}{4}\]

Use your calculator to graph this path for $x > 0$.  Describe the behaviour of $y$ as $x \rightarrow 0^{+}$ and interpret this physically.}
{ From the graph, it appears that as $x \rightarrow 0^{+}$, $y \rightarrow \infty$.  This is due to the presence of the $\ln(x)$ term in the function.  This means that Fritzy will never catch Chewbacca, which makes sense since Chewbacca has a head start and Fritzy only runs as fast as he does.
