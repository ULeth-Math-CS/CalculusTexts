{Use a graphing utility to graph $y = R(x)$ and determine the number of TVs which should be sold to maximize revenue.  What is the maximum revenue?
}
{The calculator gives the location  of the absolute maximum (rounded to three decimal places) as $x \approx 6.305$ and $y \approx 1115.417$.  Since $x$ represents the number of TVs sold in hundreds, $x = 6.305$ corresponds to $630.5$ TVs.  Since we can't sell half of a TV, we compare $R(6.30) \approx 1115.415$ and $R(6.31) \approx 1115.416$, so selling $631$ TVs results in a (slightly) higher revenue.  Since $y$ represents the revenue in \textit{thousands} of dollars, the maximum revenue is $\$ 1,\!115,\!416$.
