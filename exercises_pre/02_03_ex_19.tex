{\label{fixedperimetermaxareagarden} Skippy wishes to plant a vegetable garden along one side of his house.  In his garage, he found 32 linear feet of fencing.  Since one side of the garden will border the house, Skippy doesn't need fencing along that side.  What are the dimensions of the garden which will maximize the area of the garden?  What is the maximum  area of the garden?}
{8 feet by 16 feet; maximum area is 128 square feet.}
