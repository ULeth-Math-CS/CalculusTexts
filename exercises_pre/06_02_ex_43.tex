{\label{HendersonHasselbalch} \index{Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation} The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:  Suppose $HA$ represents a weak acid. Then we have a reversible chemical reaction 
\[HA \rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}.\]  
The acid disassociation constant, $K_{a}$, is given by 
\[K_{\alpha} = \frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = [H^{+}]\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]},\]
where the square brackets denote the concentrations just as they did in Exercise \ref{pHexercise} in Section \ref{IntroExpLogs}.  The symbol p$K_{a}$ is defined similarly to pH in that p$K_{a} = -\log(K_{a})$.  Using the definition of pH from Exercise \ref{pHexercise} and the properties of logarithms, derive the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation which states 
\[\mbox{pH} = \mbox{p}K_{a} + \log\dfrac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\]}
