{In Exercise \ref{Sasquatchfunc1} in Section \ref{FunctionNotation}, the population of Sasquatch in Portage County was modeled by the function $P(t) = \frac{150t}{t + 15}$, where $t = 0$ represents the year 1803.  When were there fewer than 100 Sasquatch in Portage County?}
{$P(t) < 100$ on $(-15, 30)$, and the portion of this which lies in the applied domain is $[0,30)$.  Since $t=0$ corresponds to the year 1803, from 1803 through the end of 1832, there were fewer than 100 Sasquatch in Portage County.
