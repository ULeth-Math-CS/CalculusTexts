{Rework Example \ref{boxnotopex} assuming the box is to be made from an 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper. Using scissors and tape, construct the box.  Are you surprised?\footnote{Consider decorating the box and presenting it to your instructor. If done well enough, maybe your instructor will issue you some bonus points.  Or maybe not.}

{$V(x) = x(8.5-2x)(11-2x) = 4x^3-39x^2+93.5x$, $0 < x < 4.25$.  Volume is maximized when $x \approx 1.58$, so the dimensions of the box with maximum volume are: height $\approx$ 1.58 inches, width $\approx$ 5.34 inches, and depth $\approx$ 7.84 inches.  The maximum volume is $\approx$ 66.15 cubic inches.
