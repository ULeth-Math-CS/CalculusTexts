The graph is not symmetric about the $x$-axis (e.g. $(3, 1)$ is on the graph but $(3, -1)$ is not) \smallskip

The graph is not symmetric about the $y$-axis (e.g. $(3, 1)$ is on the graph but $(-3, 1)$ is not) \smallskip

The graph is not symmetric about the origin (e.g. $(3, 1)$ is on the graph but $(-3, -1)$ is not)
