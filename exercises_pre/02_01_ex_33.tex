{An on-demand publisher charges $\$22.50$ to print a 600 page book and $\$15.50$ to print a 400 page book.  Find a linear function which models the cost of a book $C$ as a function of the number of pages $p$.  Interpret the slope of the linear function and find and interpret $C(0)$.}
{ $C(p) = 0.035p + 1.5 \;$  The slope $0.035$ means it costs $3.5$\textcent \, per page.  $C(0) = 1.5$ means there is a fixed, or start-up, cost of $\$1.50$ to make each book.}
