{The cost, in cents, to produce $x$ cups of Mountain Thunder Lemonade at Junior's Lemonade Stand  is $C(x) = 18x + 240$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in cents per cup,  is $p(x) = 90-3x$, $0 \leq x \leq 30$.}
{\begin{itemize}

\item  $C(0) = 240$, so the fixed costs are $240$\textcent \,  or $\$2.40$.

\item  $\overline{C}(10) = 42$, so when 10 cups of lemonade are made, the cost per cup is $42$\textcent.

\item  $p(5) = 75$, so to sell $5$ cups of lemonade, set the price at $75$\textcent \,  per cup.

\item $R(x) = -3x^2+90x$, $0 \leq x \leq 30$

\item  $P(x) = -3x^2+72x-240$, $0 \leq x \leq 30$

\item  $P(x) = 0$ when $x = 4$ and $x=20$.  These are the `break even' points, so selling $4$ cups of lemonade or $20$ cups of lemonade will guarantee the revenue earned exactly recoups the cost of production.

\end{itemize}
