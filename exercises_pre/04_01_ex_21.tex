{Recall from Example \ref{costrevenueprofitex1} that the cost $C$ (in dollars) to make $x$ dOpi media players is $C(x) = 100x+2000$, $x \geq 0$.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Find a formula for the average cost $\overline{C}(x)$. Recall:  $\overline{C}(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x}$.

\item  Find and interpret $\overline{C}(1)$ and $\overline{C}(100)$.

\item  How many dOpis need to be produced so that the average cost per dOpi is $\$ 200$?

\item  Interpret the behaviour of $\overline{C}(x)$ as $x \rightarrow 0^{+}$.  (HINT:  You may want to find the fixed cost $C(0)$ to help in your interpretation.)

\item  Interpret the behaviour of $\overline{C}(x)$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$.  (HINT:  You may want to find the variable cost (defined in Example \ref{PortaBoyCost} in Section \ref{LinearFunctions}) to help in your interpretation.)

{\begin{enumerate}

\item $\overline{C}(x) = \frac{100x+2000}{x}$, $x > 0$.

\item  $\overline{C}(1) = 2100$ and $\overline{C}(100) = 120$. When just $1$ dOpi is produced, the cost per dOpi is $\$2100$, but when $100$ dOpis are produced, the cost per dOpi is $\$120$.  

\item  $\overline{C}(x) = 200$ when $x = 20$.  So to get the cost per dOpi to $\$200$, $20$ dOpis need to be produced.

\item  As $x \rightarrow 0^{+}$, $\overline{C}(x) \rightarrow \infty$.  This means that as fewer and fewer dOpis are produced, the cost per dOpi becomes unbounded.  In this situation, there is a fixed cost of $\$2000$ ($C(0) = 2000$), we are trying to spread that $\$2000$ over fewer and fewer dOpis.

\item   As $x \rightarrow \infty$,  $\overline{C}(x) \rightarrow 100^{+}$.  This means that as more and more dOpis are produced, the cost per dOpi approaches $\$100$, but is always a little more than $\$100$.  Since $\$100$ is the variable cost per dOpi ($C(x) = \underline{100}x+2000$), it means that no matter how many dOpis are produced, the average cost per dOpi will always be a bit higher than the variable cost to produce a dOpi.  As before, we can attribute this to the $\$2000$ fixed cost, which factors into the average cost per dOpi no matter how many dOpis are produced.
