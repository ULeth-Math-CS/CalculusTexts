 {A tag-and-release program to study the Sasquatch population of the eponymous Sasquatch National Park is begun. From a 200 foot tall tower, a ranger spots a Sasquatch lumbering through the wilderness directly towards the tower. Let $\theta$ denote the angle of depression from the top of the tower to a point on the ground. If the range of the rifle with a tranquillizer dart is 300 feet, find the smallest value of $\theta$ for which the corresponding point on the ground is in range of the rifle. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a degree.}
