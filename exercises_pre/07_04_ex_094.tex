{Let $\theta$ be a Quadrant III angle with $\cos(\theta) = -\dfrac{1}{5}$.  Show that this is not enough information to determine the sign of  $\sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right)$ by first assuming $3\pi < \theta < \dfrac{7\pi}{2}$ and then assuming $\pi < \theta < \dfrac{3\pi}{2}$ and computing $\sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right)$ in both cases.}
