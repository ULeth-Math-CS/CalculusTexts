{The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the US (in billions of dollars) $t$ years after the year 2000 can be modelled by: \[ G(t) = 9743.77 e^{0.0514t}\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Find and interpret $G(0)$.

\item  According to the model, what should have been the GDP in 2007?  In 2010?  (According to the   \href{http://1.usa.gov/iimT40}{\underline{US Department of Commerce}}, the 2007 GDP was $\$14,369.1$ billion and the 2010 GDP was $\$14,657.8$ billion.)

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}  \item  $G(0) = 9743.77$  This means that the GDP of the US in 2000 was $\$9743.77$ billion dollars.

\item  $G(7) = 13963.24$ and $G(10) = 16291.25$, so the model predicted a GDP of $\$ 13,963.24$ billion in 2007 and $\$ 16,291.25$ billion in 2010. 

\end{enumerate}}
