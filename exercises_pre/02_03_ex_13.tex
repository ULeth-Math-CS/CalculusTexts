{The daily cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ Sasquatch Berry Pies is $C(x) = 3x + 36$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in  dollars per pie,  is $p(x) = 12-0.5x$, $0 \leq x \leq 24$.}
{\begin{itemize}

\item $P(x) = -0.5 x^2+9x-36$, for $0 \leq x \leq 24$

\item  $9$ pies should be made and sold to maximize the daily profit.

\item The maximum daily profit is $\$4.50$.

\item  The price per pie should be set at $\$7.50$ to maximize profit.

\item  The break even points are $x=6$ and $x=12$, so to make a profit, between 6 and 12 pies  need to be made and sold daily.

\end{itemize}
