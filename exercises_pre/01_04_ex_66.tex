{The volume $V$ enclosed by a sphere, in cubic feet, is a function of the radius of the sphere $r$, when measured in feet.  This relation is expressed by the formula $V(r) =\frac{4\pi}{3} r^{3}$ for $r > 0$.  Find $V(3)$ and solve $V(r) = \frac{32\pi}{3}$.  Interpret your answers to each.  Why is $r$ restricted to $r > 0$?}
{$V(3) = 36\pi$, so the volume enclosed by a sphere with radius $3$ feet is $36\pi$ cubic feet.  The solution to $V(r) = \frac{32\pi}{3}$ is $r = 2$.  This means for the volume enclosed by the sphere to be $\frac{32\pi}{3}$ cubic feet, the radius needs to $2$ feet.  Since $r$ represents a radius (length), $r > 0$.}
