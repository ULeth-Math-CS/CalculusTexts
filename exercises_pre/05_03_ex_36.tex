{Rework Example \ref{SasquatchCable} so that the outpost is 10 miles from Route 117 and the nearest junction box is 30 miles down the road for the post.}
{$C(x) = 15x+20\sqrt{100+(30-x)^2}$, $0 \leq x \leq 30$.  The calculator gives the absolute minimum at $\approx (18.66, 582.29)$.  This means to minimize the cost, approximately 18.66 miles of cable should be run along Route 117 before turning off the road and heading towards the outpost.  The minimum cost to run the cable is approximately $\$582.29$.}
