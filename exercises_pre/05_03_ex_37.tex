{The volume $V$ of a right cylindrical cone depends on the radius of its base $r$ and its height $h$ and is given by the formula $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$.  The surface area $S$ of a right cylindrical cone also depends on $r$ and $h$ according to the formula $S = \pi r \sqrt{r^2+h^2}$.  Suppose a cone is to have a volume of 100 cubic centimetres. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item  \label{heightintermsofr} Use the formula for volume to find the height $h$ as a function of $r$.
\item  Use the formula for surface area and your answer to \ref{heightintermsofr} to find the surface area $S$ as a function of $r$.
\item  Use your calculator to find the values of $r$ and $h$ which minimize the surface area.  What is the minimum surface area?  Round your answers to two decimal places.

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item  $h(r) = \frac{300}{\pi r^2}$, $r > 0$.
\item  $S(r) = \pi r \sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{300}{\pi r^2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi^2 r^6+90000}}{r}$, $r>0$
\item  The calculator gives the absolute minimum at the point $\approx (4.07, 90.23)$.  This means the radius should be (approximately) 4.07 centimetres and the height should be 5.76 centimetres to give a minimum surface area of 90.23 square centimetres.
