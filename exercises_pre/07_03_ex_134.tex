{As we did in Exercise \ref{cofunctionforeshadowing} in Section \ref{TheUnitCircle}, let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the two acute angles of a right triangle.  (Thus $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complementary angles.)  Show that $\sec(\alpha) = \csc(\beta)$ and $\tan(\alpha) = \cot(\beta)$.  The fact that co-functions of complementary angles are equal in this case is not an accident and a more general result will be given in Section \ref{Identities}.
