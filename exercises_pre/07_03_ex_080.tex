{From the observation deck of the lighthouse at Sasquatch Point 50 feet above the surface of Lake Ippizuti, a lifeguard spots a boat out on the lake sailing directly toward the lighthouse.  The first sighting had an angle of depression of $8.2^{\circ}$ and the second sighting had an angle of depression of $25.9^{\circ}$.  How far had the boat travelled between the sightings?}
{The boat has travelled about 244 feet.}
