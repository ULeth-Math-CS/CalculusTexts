{If the voltage in the circuit in Exercise \ref{explogsappcircuitone} above is switched off after 30 seconds, the current is given by the piecewise-defined function 

\[i(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} 2 - 2e^{-10t} & \mbox{if} & 0 \leq t < 30 \\ [6pt]
\left(2 - 2e^{-300}\right) e^{-10t+300} & \mbox{if} & t \geq 30 \end{array} \right.\]  

With the help of your calculator, graph $y = i(t)$ and discuss with your classmates the physical significance of the two parts of the graph $0 \leq t < 30$ and $t \geq 30$.}
