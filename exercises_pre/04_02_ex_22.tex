{In Example \ref{intropolyexample} in Section \ref{GraphsofPolynomials} we showed that $p(x) = \frac{4x+x^3}{x}$ is not a polynomial even though its formula reduced to $4 + x^{2}$ for $x \neq 0$.  However, it is a rational function similar to those studied in the section.  With the help of your classmates, graph $p(x)$.}
