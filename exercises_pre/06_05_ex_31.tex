{A pork roast\footnote{This roast was enjoyed by Jeff and his family on June 10, 2009.  This is real data, folks!} was taken out of a hardwood smoker when its internal temperature had reached $180^{\circ}$F and it was allowed to rest in a $75^{\circ}$F house for 20 minutes after which its internal temperature had dropped to $170^{\circ}$F. Assuming that the temperature of the roast follows Newton's Law of Cooling (Equation \ref{newtonslawofcooling}),

\begin{enumerate}

\item Express the temperature $T$ (in $^{\circ}$F) as a function of time $t$ (in minutes).

\item Find the time at which the roast would have dropped to $140^{\circ}$F had it not been carved and eaten. 

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item $T(t) = 75 + 105e^{-0.005005t}$

\item The roast would have cooled to $140^{\circ}$F in about 95 minutes.

\end{enumerate}}
