{The cost, in cents, to produce $x$ cups of Mountain Thunder Lemonade at Junior's Lemonade Stand  is $C(x) = 18x + 240$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in cents per cup,  is $p(x) = 90-3x$, $0 \leq x \leq 30$.}
{\begin{itemize}

\item  $P(x) = -3x^2+72x-240$, for $0 \leq x \leq 30$

\item  $12$ cups of lemonade need to be made and sold to maximize profit.

\item  The maximum profit is $192$\textcent \, or $\$1.92$.

\item  The price per cup should be set at $54$\textcent \, per cup to maximize profit.

\item  The break even points are $x=4$ and $x=20$, so to make a profit, between 4 and 20 cups of lemonade need to be made and sold.


\end{itemize}
