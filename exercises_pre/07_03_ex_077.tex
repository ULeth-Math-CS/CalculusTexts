{The broadcast tower for radio station WSAZ (Home of ``Algebra in the Morning with Carl and Jeff'') has two enormous flashing red lights on it: one at the very top and one a few feet below the top.  From a point 5000 feet away from the base of the tower on level ground the angle of elevation to the top light is $7.970^{\circ}$ and to the second light is $7.125^{\circ}$.  Find the distance between the lights to the nearest foot.}
{The lights are about 75 feet apart.}
