{One day, Donnie observes that the wind is blowing at 6 miles per hour.  A unladen swallow nesting near Donnie's house flies three quarters of a mile down the road (in the direction of the wind), turns around, and returns exactly 4 minutes later.  What is the airspeed of the unladen swallow?  (Here, `airspeed' is the speed that the swallow can fly in still air.) }
{24 miles per hour}
