{ A mobile plan charges a base monthly rate of $\$10$ for the first $500$ minutes of air time plus a charge of $15$\textcent \, for each additional minute.  Write a piecewise-defined linear function which calculates the monthly cost $C$ (in dollars) for using $m$ minutes of air time. 

\textbf{HINT:}  You may want to revisit Exercise \ref{piecewisemobile} in Section \ref{FunctionNotation}}
{${\displaystyle C(m) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} 10 & \mbox{ if } & 0 \leq m \leq 500 \\
                                                            10+0.15(m-500) & \mbox{ if } & m > 500
                                     \end{array} \right. }$
