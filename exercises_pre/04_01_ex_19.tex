{The cost $C$ in dollars to remove $p$\% of the invasive species of Ippizuti fish from Sasquatch Pond is given by \[C(p) = \frac{1770p}{100 - p}, \quad 0 \leq p < 100 \]

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find and interpret $C(25)$ and $C(95)$.
\item What does the vertical asymptote at $x = 100$ mean within the context of the problem?  
\item What percentage of the Ippizuti fish can you remove for  \$40000?

\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate}

\item $C(25) = 590$ means it costs \$590 to remove 25\% of the fish and and $C(95)= 33630$ means it would cost \$33630 to remove 95\% of the fish from the pond.
\item The vertical asymptote at $x = 100$ means that as we try to remove 100\% of the fish from the pond, the cost increases without bound; i.e., it's impossible to remove all of the fish.  
\item For \$40000 you could remove about 95.76\% of the fish.

\end{enumerate}}
