{The yo-yo in exercise \ref{yoyotrick} from Section \ref{Angles}.

Recall: The radius of the circle is 28 inches and it completes one revolution in 3 seconds.}
{$r = 28$ inches, $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{3} \, \frac{\text{radians}}{\text{second}}$,  $x = 28 \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3} \, t \right)$, $y = 28 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3} \, t \right)$.  Here $x$ and $y$ are measured in inches and $t$ is measured in seconds.}
