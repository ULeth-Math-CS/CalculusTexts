{Analytically show that the function $f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 1$ is one-to-one.  Since finding a formula for its inverse is beyond the scope of this textbook, use Theorem \ref{inversefunctionprops} to help you compute $f^{-1}(1), \; f^{-1}(5), \;$ and $f^{-1}(-3)$.}
{Given that $f(0) = 1$, we have $f^{-1}(1) = 0$.  Similarly $f^{-1}(5) = 1$ and $f^{-1}(-3) = -1$}
