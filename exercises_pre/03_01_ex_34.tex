{Show that the end behaviour of a linear function $f(x) = mx + b$ is as it should be according to the results we've established in the section for polynomials of odd degree.\footnote{Remember, to be a linear function, $m \neq 0$.}  (That is, show that the graph of a linear function is ``up on one side and down on the other'' just like the graph of $y = a_{n}x^{n}$ for odd numbers $n$.)
