{The cost, in dollars, to produce $x$ bottles of $100 \%$ All-Natural Certified Free-Trade Organic Sasquatch Tonic is $C(x) = 10x+100$, $x \geq 0$ and the price-demand function, in dollars per bottle,  is $p(x) = 35 - x$, $0 \leq x \leq 35$. }
{ \begin{itemize}

\item  $C(0) = 100$, so the fixed costs are $\$100$.

\item  $\overline{C}(10) = 20$, so when 10 bottles of tonic are produced, the cost per bottle is $\$20$.

\item  $p(5) = 30$, so to sell $5$ bottles of tonic, set the price at $\$30$ per bottle.

\item $R(x) = -x^2+35x$, $0 \leq x \leq 35$

\item  $P(x) = -x^2+25x-100$, $0 \leq x \leq 35$

\item  $P(x) = 0$ when $x = 5$ and $x=20$.  These are the `break even' points, so selling $5$ bottles of tonic or $20$ bottles of tonic will guarantee the revenue earned exactly recoups the cost of production.

\end{itemize}
