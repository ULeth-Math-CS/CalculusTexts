{\noindent In Exercises}
{,  we list some radioactive isotopes and their associated half-lives.  Assume that each decays according to the formula $A(t) = A_{\text{\tiny $0$}}e^{kt}$ where $A_{\text{\tiny $0$}}$ is the initial amount of the material and $k$ is the decay constant. For each isotope:

\begin{itemize}

\item  Find the decay constant $k$.  Round your answer to four decimal places.

\item  Find a function which gives the amount of isotope $A$ which remains after time $t$.  (Keep the units of $A$ and $t$ the same as the given data.)

\item  Determine how long it takes for $90 \%$ of the material to decay.  Round your answer to two decimal places.  (HINT:  If $90 \%$ of the material decays, how much is left?)

\end{itemize}}
