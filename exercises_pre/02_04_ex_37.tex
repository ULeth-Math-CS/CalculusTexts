{If a slingshot is used to shoot a marble straight up into the air from 2 meters above the ground with an initial velocity of 30 meters per second, for what values of time $t$ will the marble be over 35 meters above the ground? (Refer to Exercise \ref{whatgoesup} in Section \ref{QuadraticFunctions} for assistance if needed.)  Round your answers to two decimal places.}
{$s(t) = -4.9t^2 + 30t + 2$.  $s(t) > 35$ on (approximately)  $(1.44, 4.68)$.  This means between 1.44 and 4.68 seconds after it is launched into the air, the marble is more than 35 feet off the ground. }
