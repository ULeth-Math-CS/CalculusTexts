{In part \ref{cosinepolynomial} of Example \ref{doubleangleex}, we wrote $\cos(3\theta)$ as a polynomial in terms of $\cos(\theta)$.  In Exercise \ref{cosine4theta}, we had you verify an identity which expresses $\cos(4\theta)$ as a polynomial in terms of $\cos(\theta)$.   Can you find a polynomial in terms of $\cos(\theta)$ for $\cos(5\theta)$?  $\cos(6\theta)$?  Can you find a pattern so that $\cos(n\theta)$ could be written as a polynomial in cosine for any natural number $n$?}
