{In the scenario of Theorem \ref{equationsforcircularmotion}, we assumed that at $t=0$, the object was at the point $(r,0)$.  If this is not the case,  we can adjust the equations of motion by introducing a `time delay.'   If $t_{0} > 0$ is the first time the object passes through the point $(r,0)$, show, with the help of your classmates, the equations of motion are $x = r \cos(\omega (t - t_{0}))$ and $y = r \sin(\omega (t-t_{0}))$.}
