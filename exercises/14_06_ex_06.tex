{Example of numerical instability:
Take $y' = -5y$, $y(0) = 1$.  We know that the
solution should decay to zero as $x$ grows.
Using Euler's method, start with $h=1$ and compute
$y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ to try to approximate $y(4)$.  What happened?
Now halve the interval.  Keep halving the interval and approximating $y(4)$
until the numbers you are getting
start to stabilize (that is, until they start going towards zero).
Note: You might want to use a calculator.}
