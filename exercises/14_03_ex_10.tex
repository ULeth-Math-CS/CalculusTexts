{Is it possible to solve $y' = xy$ for $y(0) = 0$?  Is the solution unique?}
{Yes a solution exists.  $y' = f(x,y)$ where $f(x,y) = xy$.  The function
$f(x,y)$ is continuous and 
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x$, which is also continuous near $(0,0)$.
So a solution exists and is unique.  (In fact $y=0$ is the solution).}
