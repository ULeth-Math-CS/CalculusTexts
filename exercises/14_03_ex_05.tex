{Is it possible to solve the equation $y' = y\sqrt{\lvert x\rvert}$ for
$y(0) = 0$?  Is the solution unique?
Justify.}
{Yes, on both accounts. For $f(x,y)=y\sqrt{\lvert x\rvert}$, the function is continuous everywhere, and the partial derivative $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = \sqrt{\lvert x\rvert}$ exists and is everywhere continuous.
