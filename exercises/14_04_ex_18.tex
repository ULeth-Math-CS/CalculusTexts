{Take Example \ref{sep_coffeeexample} with the same numbers: 89 degrees at
$t=0$, 85 degrees at $t=1$, and ambient temperature
of 22 degrees.  Suppose these temperatures were measured with precision of
$\pm 0.5$ degrees.  Given this imprecision, the time
it takes the coffee to cool to (exactly) 60 degrees is also only known in a
certain range.  Find this range.  Hint: Think about what kind of error makes
the cooling time longer and what shorter.}
{The range is approximately 7.45 to 12.15 minutes.}
