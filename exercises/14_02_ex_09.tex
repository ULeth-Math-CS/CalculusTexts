{A spaceship is travelling at the speed \unitfrac[$2t^2+1$]{km}{s} ($t$ is
time in seconds).  It is pointing directly away from Earth and at time $t=0$
it is 1000 kilometres from earth.  How far from earth is it at one minute from
time $t=0$?}
{Letting $r(t)$ denote the distance from Earth in kilometres, with $t$ measured in seconds, we have $r'(t) = 2t^2+1$, so $r(t) = \dfrac{2}{3}t^3+t+1000$ for the initial condition $r(0)=1000$. After one minute, we have $t=60$, so the distance is $r(60) = \dfrac{2}{3}(60^3)+60+1000$ km.}
