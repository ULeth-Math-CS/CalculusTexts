{(Challenging) Take $y' = f(x,y)$, $y(0) = 0$, where $f(x,y) > 1$
for all $x$ and $y$.  If
the solution exists for all $x$, can you say
what happens to $y(x)$ as $x$ goes to positive infinity?  Explain.}
{We have to have $y\to \infty$ as $x\to infty$: We begin at $(0,0)$ and $f(0,0)>1$, so $y'>1$. If we compare to the function $f(x)=x$, we have $y(0)=f(0)$ and $y'(x)>f'(x)$ for all $x$, which implies that $y(x)>f(x)$ for all $x$.}
