{Suppose a water tank is being pumped out at \unitfrac[3]{L}{min}.  The
water tank starts at \unit[10]{L} of clean water.
Water with
toxic substance is flowing into the tank at \unitfrac[2]{L}{min},
with concentration \unitfrac[$20t$]{g}{L} at time $t$.
When the tank is half empty, how many grams of toxic substance are in the
tank (assuming perfect mixing)?}
{$250$ grams}
