{Let $y'' + 2y' - 8y = 0$.  Now try a solution of the form $y = e^{rx}$ for
some (unknown) constant $r$.  Is this a solution
for some $r$?  If so, find all such $r$.}
{Putting $y=e^{rx}$ gives $y' = re^{rx} = ry$ and $y'' = r^2e^{rx}=r^2y$. If this is a solution we must have $r^2y+2ry-8y=0$. Since $y\neq 0$, this gives $r^2+2r-8=0$, so there are two values of $r$ that give a solution: $r=2$ and $r=-4$.}
