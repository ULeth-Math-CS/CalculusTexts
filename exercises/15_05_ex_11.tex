{Initially 5 grams of salt are dissolved in 20 litres of water.  Brine
with concentration of salt 2 grams of salt per litre is added at a rate
of 3 litres a minute.  The tank is mixed well and is drained at 3 litres
a minute.  How long does the process have to continue until there are 20 grams
of salt in the tank?}
{For $t=\dfrac{20}{3}\ln\left(\dfrac{7}{4}\right) \approx 3.73$ minutes.}
