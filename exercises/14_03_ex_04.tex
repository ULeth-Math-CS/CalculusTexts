{Is it possible to solve the equation $y' = \dfrac{xy}{\cos x}$ for $y(0) = 1$?
Justify.}
{The function $f(x,y) = \dfrac{xy}{\cos x}$, and $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = \dfrac{x}{\cos x}$ both exist and are continuous near the point $(0,1)$ (note $\cos(0)=1$). Therefore a solution is guaranteed by Picard's Theorem.}
