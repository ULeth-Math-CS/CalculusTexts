{Suppose we have bacteria on a plate and suppose that we are slowly adding
a toxic substance such that the rate of growth is slowing down.  That is,
suppose that $\frac{dP}{dt} = (2-0.1t)P$.  If $P(0) = 1000$, find
the population at $t=5$.}
{$P(5) = 1000 e^{2 \times 5 - 0.05 \times {5}^2} = 1000 e^{8.75} \approx
6.31 \times {10}^6$}
