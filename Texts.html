<title> Course Textbooks for Calculus </title>
</head>

<p> This page provides links to free textbooks for the courses Math 1560 (Calculus I) and Math 2560 (Calculus II) at the University of Lethbridge. They are designed to cover the content for each course as prescribed by the revised curricula as of September 2015. I've also added a text that covers the material in Math 2570 (Calculus III) under the "old" curriculum (a.k.a. the current curriculum, which will be replaced in Fall 2016).</p>

<p>The primary source material is the <a href="http://www.apexcalculus.com">APEX Calculus</a> textbook. You can visit their website to get more information on their project or to access the original versions of the texts. (These texts have been customized to fit the University of Lethbridge courses.)</p>
