University of Lethbridge Calculus Texts

These texts are a fork of the APEX Calculus textbooks, adapted to the curriculum at the University of Lethbridge.
As of June 2018, the books have been updated to incorporate improvements made in the latest version of the APEX books, APEX Version 4.

For best results, the books should be compiled using XeLaTeX on a computer with the Calibri font installed. (This is a Windows font, so this option unfortunately isn't available on most Linux machines, unless Calibri has been separately purchased and installed.) If PDFLaTeX is run instead, the Carlito font will be used. This is a Google font meant to be metric compatible with Calibri. This is almost -- but not quite -- the case. If you compile with Carlito the page breaks will be different in places, and you'll have to check for overlapping margin graphics and notes, and make adjustments as needed.

I'd like to thank the people involved with the APEX Calculus project for making these texts possible. The README from their GitHub repository follows below. I'd also like to thank Jiri Lebl for the use of his "Notes on Diffy Qs" textbook, the first chapter of which I've ported over to the APEX format for the Math 2560 textbook, and Carl Stitz and Jeff Zeager, whose Precalculus textbook forms the basis for the first half of the Math 1010 textbook.
